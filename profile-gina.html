		<h3>HELLO! 你好!</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Taiwan then moved to Seattle 5 years ago after graduating from university.</p>
        <p>I got my bachelor's degree in Business administration focusing in sports management, and worked in marketing field but decided to change my career path. Now I'm getting a certificate in Database Design & Administration. I've always been passionate about sports and love problem solving, so my goal is to apply my new skills in sports industry as a database developer. </p>
        <p>I'm still quite new to the IT world, but so far I'm enjoying it and am excited to keep learning new things everyday!</p>
