        <p>Hello, my name is Vanver Brown.  I'm in school to learn skills that will hopefully will get me a new job
        in an industry I am interested in.  I've have had an interest in computers, however when I was previously in 
        school I studied business administration and marketing and found out after I had my bachelors I didn't enjoy 
        the work I was doing.  So far I've really enjoyed the IT courses I'm in.</p>
        
        <p>I've lived on Capitol Hill for the past six years and have seen a lot of change in the neighborhood and the
        city itself.  I'm hoping by going back to school and learning new skills I can continue to live here.</p>
